    <p> the first week of coding A tough one, the second week so so. I haven't partied for a decade, I'm crying for it. Everyday i code from day light to sunset. I can't even step out because i got to wake up early in the morning to get back to the coding routine. I digest the material slow. Homework is very challenging not straight forward but i try hard to do it. My misery!</p>

    <p>Coding right now can't even watch the NBA all star game. I'm sorry for my self. I can't even make to the gym anymore. I'm goddamn miserable but by next week i will start taking over my life by hitting my favorite spots. Clubing, and strip clubs, get a 100 pounds cake shaking on me with the dopest lap dances. Enjoy life! Fuck coding!!
